Hormone imbalances can be treated in several ways, ranging from HRT to lifestyle changes, to surgical options.

For example, PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) is when you have cysts on your ovaries, which causes problems with menstrual cycles. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms via lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, along with medications like hormonal birth controls.

Along with birth control, metformin can be used to treat insulin resistance, and other fertility medications can be used to combat pregnancy and other reproductive dysfunctions.

Another example is Turner Syndrome (missing or partly missing X chromosome). Treatment could include HRT, however surgical options are not available. Medications can be prescribed to reduce the effects, however, it affects your entire body and lifestyle.

While some hormone imbalances have no cure, finding the right treatment that increases quality of life and reduces symptoms is important.

Treating these imbalances is important because they can lead to lifelong medical problems. For example, chronic stress (high adrenaline and cortisol) can lead to hypertension, increased cardiovascular risks, and gastrointestinal issues. Other long-term effects include osteoporosis, immunocompromisation, mental health disorders, and increased risk of cancer.

If you are at risk for or are showing symptoms of hormone imbalances, seek medical attention and possible treatment.
